<hr />
<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>I love the sales environment, the financial markets and the ambition of Jordan Belfort. Also, it teaches a great lesson by showing how everithing falls apart when you're doing things just to make money, with no concern of generating value to the society.</p>
<h3>The Big Short</h3>
<p>Great movie about capital markets. Simply love the jokes and the memes.</p>
<h3>The Founder</h3>
<p>Can't get enough movies about entrepreneurship.</p>
